# Engineer-Calculator
Engineering Calculator â€“ is a program that is designed to perform various types of engineering calculations.
In engineering and design work it is often necessary to calculate the mass of rolled metal from which the construction of the projected product will consist. Also often have to perform the reverse operation - the calculation of the total length of rolled metal available in the warehouse.
Gears are widely used in various machines and mechanisms to transmit torque from the engine. During design and repair works, the geometrical parameters of the gears must be calculated.
This program performs operations:
- calculates the weight of rolled metal depending on the geometric dimensions and type of metal;
- calculates the length of the metal, depending on the geometric dimensions, weight and type of metal;
- calculates the geometric parameters of the gears using the number of teeth and the module.
